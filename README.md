PROJECT : 🧠 Sentiment Analysis using NLP and Machine Learning
✅ Level 1- Task 4

This project focuses on analyzing the emotional tone of text data—positive, negative, or neutral—using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning models.

🔍 Objective

To classify sentiment in user-generated content from Twitter and app reviews using text preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification algorithms.

📂 Datasets Used

Twitter_Data.csv: Cleaned tweets labeled with sentiment (-1, 0, 1)

user_reviews.csv: Translated app reviews with sentiment labels (Positive, Neutral, Negative)

📌 Key Concepts Covered

✅ Sentiment Analysis

✅ Natural Language Processing (stopword removal, lemmatization)

✅ Feature Engineering (TF-IDF)

✅ Classification using Naive Bayes and SVM

✅ Data Visualization of sentiment distribution

⚙️ Technologies Used
